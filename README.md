# Auto Rename File Service (Optimized Rebuild)

An Android application that automatically renames files in monitored directories using sequential numbering.

**Status:** üöß In Development - Rebuilding from scratch with modern optimization practices

## Project Goals

This is a complete rebuild of an existing Auto Rename File Service app, reimagined with:
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient memory usage, lazy loading, and proper coroutine management
- **Modern architecture**: Clean Architecture with MVI/MVVM, Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin coroutines
- **Code quality**: Modular design, dependency injection (Hilt/Koin), and comprehensive testing
- **User experience**: Smooth animations, responsive UI, and proper error handling
- **Best practices**: Latest Android guidelines, Material 3 design, and optimized build configuration

## Summary

Auto Rename File Service helps you quickly batch-rename selected media files with clean, sequential names. You pick the files, configure numbering (start value, digit count, optional prefix), preview the results, and then apply the changes while keeping each file's original extension. The app supports Android's scoped storage and media scanning, and can also watch folders in real time using FileObserver.

- Batch-rename images/videos with sequential numbering and optional prefix
- Preserve file extensions and (optionally) the original selection order
- Choose a destination folder and preview filenames before committing or automatically create a new folder in the folder which contain the files
- Android 10+ compatible (scoped storage) with MediaStore updates for proper indexing
- Optional real-time monitoring via FileObserver
- Light/dark theme with customizable background

## Optimization Targets

### Performance
- **Memory efficiency**: Use of Sequences for large collections, proper Bitmap recycling, LRU caching strategies
- **Coroutine optimization**: Structured concurrency, Flow for reactive streams, proper dispatcher selection
- **Lazy initialization**: Viewmodels, dependencies, and resources loaded only when needed
- **RecyclerView optimization**: ViewHolder pattern, DiffUtil for efficient updates, pagination for large lists
- **Image loading**: Coil/Glide with proper sizing, caching, and placeholder strategies

### Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain, Data, and Presentation layers with clear separation
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for compile-time DI, scoped dependencies, and testability
- **State management**: MVI/MVVM with sealed classes, immutable state, and unidirectional data flow
- **Repository pattern**: Single source of truth, offline-first capability, proper error handling
- **Use cases**: Single responsibility, reusable business logic encapsulation
- **Modularization**: Feature modules (BatchProcessor, FolderScanner, UriPathResolver, FileOperationsManager, PermissionsManager)

### Code Quality
- **Modularization**: Feature modules, shared core module, proper dependency graphs
- **Testing**: Unit tests with MockK, UI tests with Compose Testing, integration tests
- **Code style**: Ktlint/Detekt for consistent formatting and static analysis
- **Documentation**: KDoc comments, architecture decision records (ADRs)
- **Error handling**: Sealed Result types, proper exception handling, user-friendly error messages
- **Utilities**: SafeImageLoader for robust URI handling, proper resource management

### Build Optimization
- **Build speed**: Gradle configuration cache, parallel execution, build cache optimization
- **APK size**: R8/ProGuard optimization, resource shrinking, vector drawables
- **Build variants**: Proper flavor dimensions, BuildConfig fields, product flavors
- **Dependencies**: Version catalogs, dependency analysis, avoiding over-fetching

## Features (Planned)

### Batch file renaming
- Select multiple media files from device storage or scan a folder (images/videos supported)
- Choose a destination folder (source vs destination selections are kept independent)
- Numbering options: start number, digit count, and optional custom prefix
- Natural sorting and optional preservation of original selection order
- Preview new filenames before processing and maintain original file extensions
- MediaStore refresh so renamed files immediately appear correctly in gallery/apps

### Dynamic theme and universal background
